Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
Ans: Operators are symbols that perform specific actions on operands (data or values). They come in various types, each serving a distinct purpose:

Role of Operators in JavaScript:
a. Performing Calculations:
-Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / handle basic mathematical operations on numbers.
-Comparison operators like >, <, ==, and != evaluate relationships between values, allowing for conditional statements and branching logic.

b. Manipulating Data:
-Assignment operators like = and += assign values to variables or update existing ones.
-Logical operators like &&, ||, and ! combine conditions and control program flow.

c.  Building Complex Functionality:
-Bitwise operators like &, |, and ^ perform operations on individual bits within a number, enabling advanced data manipulation.
-String operators like + and += concatenate strings, allowing for text manipulation and dynamic content creation.

Why are Operators Essential?

-Conciseness and Efficiency: Operators provide a compact and efficient way to express complex logic, reducing the need for verbose code.
-Control Flow and Decision Making: Operators enable conditional statements and loops, allowing programs to make decisions and react to different situations.
-Data Manipulation and Transformation: Operators manipulate and transform data, enabling programs to process information and generate desired outputs.
-Building Complex Functionality: Operators combine data and logic, enabling the creation of sophisticated features and algorithms.


Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.
Ans: ## Categorization of Operators in JavaScript based on Functionality:

JavaScript operators are diverse tools used to manipulate data and control program flow. They can be broadly categorized based on their primary function:

1. Arithmetic Operators: Perform basic mathematical calculations on numbers.
Examples: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
let sum = 5 + 3; 
let difference = 10 - 2; 

2. Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables or update existing ones.
Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
let age = 25; 
age += 1; 

3. Comparison Operators: Evaluate relationships between values and return boolean (true/false) results.
Examples: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
let isAdult = age >= 18; 
let isOdd = 10 % 2 != 0; 


4. Logical Operators: Combine conditions and control program flow based on their truth values.
Examples: &&, ||, !

if (isAdult && isStudent) {
  // eligible for student discount
} else {
  // pay full price
}

5. String Operators: Manipulate and combine strings.
Examples: +, +=, *, in, !in
let fullName = "John" + " Doe"; 

Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Ans:1. Unary Operators: 
-Require only one operand.
-Used to perform actions like negation, increment/decrement, logical NOT, type conversion, etc.

Examples:
-x: negates the value of x (e.g., -5 = -5)
++y: increments the value of y by 1 (e.g., let y = 10; ++y; y = 11)

2. Binary Operators:
-Require two operands.
Used for arithmetic operations, comparisons, assignments, string concatenation, etc.

Examples:
5 + 3: adds 5 and 3 (result: 8)
a < b: compares the values of a and b (returns true if a is less than b)

3. Ternary Operator:
-The only operator in JavaScript that requires three operands.
-Used as a concise alternative to if-else statements for simple conditional expressions.

Example: if(age >= 18){
            console.log(adult)
            }
         else{
             console.log(minor)
             }

In JavaScript, when multiple operators appear in a single expression, their order of execution matters. Precedence defines which operator gets evaluated first. Operators with higher precedence are applied before those with lower precedence. This ensures consistent and predictable results.

For example, in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, multiplication has higher precedence than addition. Therefore, it gets evaluated first: (3 * 4) + 2. This results in 14, not 10.

Associativity:

Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?
Ans: When operators have the same precedence, associativity determines the order of evaluation. Left associativity means the operator to the left is evaluated first, while right associativity means the right operator takes precedence. Most arithmetic operators in JavaScript are left associative. For example, 2 - 1 - 3 is evaluated as (2 - 1) - 3, resulting in -2.

Importance of understanding these concepts:

-Writing accurate and predictable code: Knowing the order of operations ensures your code behaves as intended. Without a clear understanding, you might encounter unexpected results and errors.

-Improving code readability: Explicitly using parentheses to enforce desired order of operations can make your code more readable for others and yourself, especially when dealing with complex expressions.

-Optimizing performance: Judicious use of parentheses can sometimes help the JavaScript engine optimize its execution, leading to slightly faster code.

-Avoiding common errors: Many common JavaScript errors arise from misunderstandings of operator precedence and associativity. Grasping these concepts helps prevent such errors and write more reliable code.
